Once opening a new turtlesim window, the first step in drawing the square was to make the
line black. This was done using the same 'service call' command as was used for the
challenge in the service part of the lab. This time, the r, g, and b values were all set to 0
to make the line black. The up arrow key was used to move the turtle forward in a straight
line, and the turtle was rotated using the 'action send_goal' command from the actions part
of the lab. This command was used to ensure the turtle was rotated pi/2 radians. These
forward movement and rotation steps were repeated until the square was closed.
